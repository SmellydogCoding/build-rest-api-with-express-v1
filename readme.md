# Build A Rest API With Express V1
---
### Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 11

Build an API for a course rating Angular application

* Tested in Firefox 50, Chrome 55, MS Edge, and IE 11

* JavaScript syntax tested with JSHint.com

There is a problem with IE 11 which causes edits for a course to not display on screen.  However, the edits are written to the database.

One of the extra credit requirements is:

> "The password value meets the minimum password requirements".

We weren't told what those requirements actually are so I choose a regex that matched these conditions:

* Password must be at least 8 characters with at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special character.
